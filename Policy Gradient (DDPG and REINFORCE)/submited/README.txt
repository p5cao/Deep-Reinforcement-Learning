Here I attach two pdf files. One is generated from latex, and the other is produced by web browser.

The orignial ipython file I also attach here, which I used to train under halfcheetah environment for ddpg.

Additionally, there is a file called source, which contains all the ipython files I used to train all environments respectively.
