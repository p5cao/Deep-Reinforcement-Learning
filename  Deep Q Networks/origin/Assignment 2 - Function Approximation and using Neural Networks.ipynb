    "The equation for the cartpole problem is nonlinear in nature, but it has been shown through robust control theory that a linear version of the equation of the form $\\dot{x} = Ax+Bu$ can be solved by a linear controller. Let us assume that we are interested in minimizing cart stray from the center, and pendulum falling. It turns out that typical techniques - open loop control, PID control, root locus, etc. is not suitable for stabilizing both the cart position (keep near center) or the pole angle (keep vertical). The solution to this question is a linear quadratic controller, but we won't be using the solution at the moment."
